    <ul>
      
      <li><span><span class="title">Current Set Up</span> - Your current set up has our Enablix files, URLs and FAQ items. These will help you familiarize with how Enablix. They also act as good illustrations for you to follow for your own content.</span></li>
      
      <li><span><span class="title">Dimensions</span> - Dimensions (aka Business Dimensions) are the heart of your set up. These are your products, solutions, industries, competitors, partners, etc, that you track in your business. We recommend you start by defining a few dimension objects. You can always come back and add more or update existing ones.</span></li>
      
      <li><span><span class="title">Content Types</span> - We have some pre-defined standard content types for marketers. You can start adding content of these types. As you expand your content library and have something that is not covered by our standard content types, we will add it for you for free.</span></li>
      
      <li><span><span class="title">Integrations</span> - We support several integrations with our platform. We integrate with cloud storage systems like Dropbox, Google Drive, Sharepoint, Box, etc. We also integrate with business applications like Salesforce, HubSpot Sales CRM, YouTube, Wordpress, Slack, Email, etc. You will learn more in the coming days. But if you don't want to wait, let us know and we will help you with enabling these integrations.</span></li>
