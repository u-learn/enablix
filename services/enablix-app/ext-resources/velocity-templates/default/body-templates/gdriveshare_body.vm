	Enablix is now integrated with Google Drive and will store all files on Google Drive. You and other Enablix Administrators should have received an email notification from Google Drive notifying you about the new Google Drive folder $obj.inputData.get('sharedFolder'). Please note that Enablix files will be stored in this folder. <br />
